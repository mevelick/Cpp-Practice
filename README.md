Examples of my work through homework assignments I have completed. Please email me if you have any good suggestions of problems or exercises that I could use to practice with. Especially that have to do with arrays, functions, and pointers. Please include solutions along with the exercises. It is greatly appreciated!! If you have any for Swift also, that would be awesome also!
